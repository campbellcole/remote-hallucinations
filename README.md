YEEEEEEEEEEE ACID BABYYYYYYY

i'm gonna be real and say that building caffe is one of the worst things a human can do.
think about it.
you have dependency hell, then trying to find the correct compute capabilities.

not to mention protobuf and libboost being a pain to actually get working.

then you have the dreadful hdf5 error which takes 20 minutes of googling to find a fix.

don't even think about trying to install caffe-cuda from apt.

AS IM TYPING THIS I GET A FATAL ERROR WITH LITERALLY NO ERROR MESSAGE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT

ok i take it back i was able to build caffe and pycaffe with cuda 10.1

still... really wish building stuff wasn't such a pain
